    In the summer’s-winter of late June in Canberra, Australia, a strange government and university town with posters up protesting kangaroo road deaths, I presented at a conference called “New Interfaces for Musical Expression.” At my panel, this artist and researcher Yann Seznec presented his project called “The Memory Cloud.” He essentially extracted all of the audio out of every video in his personal cloud library and then used that as a basis for a granular synthesizer, where he can shuffle through the sounds of his memories at random, never returning to a clip but with the ability to mess around with the pitch and other parameters.

    Yann talked a lot about the philosophical implications of this instrument: firstly, the “overly saturated” paradigm of photo and video storage that we have right now, where massive tech companies allow us to access any of our photos at all times. But these storage systems are incredibly platform-specific, profiting off of the dependence of their users. In converting all of his videos into straight-up audio tracks, and then repeating the process with another artist, Yann experienced the deep friction at every step: we are not meant to own and manipulate our files in this way.
